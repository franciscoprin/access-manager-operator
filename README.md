## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Set Okta credentials as secrets
1. Create a file named okta-secrets.yaml with the following content. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Okta domain and API token encoded in Base64.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
        name: okta-secrets
        namespace: access-manager-operator
        type: Opaque
    data:
        client-org-url: <base64_encoded_okta_domain>
        client-token: <base64_encoded_api_token>
    ```

2. To encode your Okta domain and API token in Base64, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    echo -n 'your_okta_domain' | base64 # <base64_encoded_okta_domain>
    echo -n 'your_api_token' | base64 # <base64_encoded_api_token>
    ```

    This will output the Base64 encoded values which you can then use in the YAML file.

3. Use kubectl to apply the YAML file:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f okta-secrets.yaml
    ```

4. Verify if the secrets have been created successfully, the secrets can described using the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe secret okta-secrets -n access-manager-operator
    ```

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/access-manager-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/access-manager-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
